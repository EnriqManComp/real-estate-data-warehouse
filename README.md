# real-state-warehouse-management

## Problem Statement
The task is to deliver clean and valuable data to the stakeholders (executives and data analysts). To achieve the task, we need the following:
- Set up a star schema from the raw data.
- Clean the data (formatting and removing duplicates)
- Set valuable criteria from the raw data to form a new representation, like SCD type 1 or 2.
- Drive the data through an ETL process using Airflow.

## Install

1- run docker-compose yaml file to start Airflow
